# EncryptionAssignment

This program takes in a file and encrypts or decrypts it with it's encryption method and then converts it to a hexademical to output in a .crp file
There is a decryption function which will do the inverse taking in a encrypted file and decrypt it back to it's original form
The input can be any file type that can be read by c

To encrypt on the program type the file name and put anything you want as encrypt e.g. "./cryptoMagic <file_name>" or "./cryptoMagic <file_name> -E"
For decrypt type "-D" e.g. "./cryptoMagic <file_name> -D"
the placement of -D or -E before or after the file doesn't matter
